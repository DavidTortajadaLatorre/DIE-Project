Hello, we are three Erasmus students in VUT Brno (Czech Republic), at the moment completing our Digital Electronics subject. In our case, we are learning about Machine Learning in the following way: firstly an introduction theoretical course, secondly a practical project with Edge Impulse and finally a complete example with Python. We are presenting three different results:

1-Creating a Basic Model: 

_We had several problems with the automatic labeling of our training and testing data. Edge Impulse required us to manually assign each label (or at least verify an automatic recognition) . 
That is why in the first place we are presenting a Fruit Classification Problem with just two types: apples and bananas. However we will be using a quite large manually labeled dataset: 400 approx. photographs for training and 200 approx. for testing._

2-Improving a Public Project:

_In this case we are trying to beat an already done project trying to adjust different aspects of the model such as learning rate, neural network architecture, image processing blocks… The initial accuracy we want to outperform is 82%._

3-Python Program:

_Last but not least, we opt for a “non limited” option using Python. There will be 10 different classes with a total of photographies (Training + Tesing) equal to 3398._ 

_We will discuss the problems we encountered (overfitting) as well as commenting on the use of certain crucial aspects in Machine Learning such as one hot encoding, early stopping, typical libraries, cross validation… and the reasons behind._
