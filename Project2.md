The second challenge consists of trying to beat a pre-existing model while keeping the network complexity and computing resources as close as possible to the original.

In first place we need to know what is the structure of the existing model (blocks), as well as its hyperparameters and internal settings.

**Original:** 

Learning Block: Transfer Learning

Tuning Hyperparameters: Training Cycles = 20, LR = 0.0005

Model: MobileNetV2 96x96 0.35 (final layer: 16 neurons, 0.1 dropout) 

Scheme:
